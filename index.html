                        Mindfulness meditation is a mental training practice that teaches you to slow down racing
                        thoughts, let go of negativity, and calm both your mind and body. It combines meditation with
                        the practice of mindfulness, which can be defined as a mental state that involves being fully
                        focused on "the now" so you can acknowledge and accept your thoughts, feelings, and sensations
                        without judgment. <br />
                        Techniques can vary, but in general, mindfulness meditation involves deep breathing and
                        awareness of body and mind. Practicing mindfulness meditation doesn't require props or
                        preparation (no need for candles, essential oils, or mantras, unless you enjoy them). To get
                        started, all you need is a comfortable place to sit, three to five minutes of free time, and a
                        judgment-free mindset.

                        Take a deep breath — a phrase we are all too familiar with as a last resort to relieve stress
                        and frustration. But it actually works. <br />
                        Deep breathing is a form of meditation, a practice that researchers say dates back several
                        thousand years. Research shows that meditation can reduce anxiety, sharpen memory, treat
                        symptoms of depression, promote more restful sleep, and even improve heart health. <br />
                        There are thousands of forms of meditation and with them come different breathing techniques.

                <h2 class="text-center">What are the chakras?</h2>
                <div class="about-container">
                    <p>
                        The word “chakra” comes from Sanskrit and translates to “wheel” or “disk,” referring to the
                        shape of these whirling energy centers that unite mind, body and spirit. “Everyone has seven
                        main centers of energy, also known as chakras, throughout the body, beginning at the top of the
                        head and going straight down to the bottom of your spine,” spa director Sharla Martin tells us.
                        And each one of these energy centers has a specific function. <br />
                        “Chakras process and distribute energy that is needed for our health, well-being and vitality,”
                        healing practitioner Jissel Ravelo of Vibra Wellness explains. And according to yoga tradition,
                        when your chakras are open, energy flows effortlessly throughout your body. But when your
                        chakras are blocked, internal energy builds up, which throws the mind, body and spirit
                        connection into disharmony.
