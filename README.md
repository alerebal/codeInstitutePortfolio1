# Minfulness 4 All

Minfulness 4 All is a site to provide guidance to any user who wishes to enter the world of mindfulness. What is mindfulness, how to practice it and resources to achieve it.

Throughout the page, the user can use the videos and audios to discover and practice mindfulness.

## Bugs

On the Learning and Practice pages, the main container and the footer were separated by a space. That did not happen in the Index and Contact pages.

What I did was add a border to the main container on both pages to fix it:
