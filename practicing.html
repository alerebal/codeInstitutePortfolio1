                    <h2>Guided Imagery Meditation</h2>
                    <div class="body">
                        <p class="note">
                            Guided imagery uses the power of the imagination to quickly relax your body and calm your mind.

                            Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that draws on your ability to visualize and daydream. It’s easy to practice whenever and wherever you are. All you have to do is imagine a peaceful scene in your mind. It works best if you incorporate as many sensory details as possible: what you see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. So you’re not just thinking it—you’re living it. When you engage your imagination in this way, your body and your nervous system will respond as if you’re actually there.

                    <h2>Deep Breathing Meditation</h2>
                    <div class="body">

                            When you start to feel overwhelmed, this deep breathing exercise can help you quickly rein in stress and feel more calm.

                            When we’re stressed or anxious, our breathing becomes more rapid and shallow. This in turn, makes us feel even worse—triggering symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness, and shortness of breath. This deep breathing exercise helps you slow your breathing down and relax both physically and mentally. It’s simple to learn and, best of all, it’s something you can easily practice any time and anywhere.

                            We’re often so much harder on ourselves than we are on anyone else. We judge ourselves harshly, dwell on our failures and perceived shortcomings, compare ourselves unfavorably to others, and sometimes even tell ourselves that we aren’t worthy of love or happiness. This meditation teaches you to counter those negative voices in your head with self-compassion and to remind yourself that you deserve kindness.

                            Relieve stress, anxiety, and muscle tension with this simple, yet powerful whole-body relaxation exercise.

                            When you’re experiencing anxiety, stress, or worry, one of the ways your body responds is by tightening up. Progressive muscle relaxation is a relaxation technique that helps you release the tension you’re holding in your body and feel more relaxed and calm. The technique is simple: working through the body, tense one muscle group at a time and then release the tension and notice the contrasting feeling of relaxation. Not only does progressive muscle relaxation help relieve anxiety in the moment, but with regular practice, it can also lower your overall tension and stress levels.

                            Harness the power of your breath to relieve stress, ground yourself in the present moment, and reestablish inner calm.

                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            Mindful breathing is a very basic yet powerful mindfulness meditation practice. The idea is simply to focus your attention on your breathing—to its natural rhythm and flow and the way it feels on each inhale and exhale. Focusing on the breath is particularly helpful because it serves as an anchor–something you can turn your attention to at any time if you start to feel stressed or carried away by negative emotions.
